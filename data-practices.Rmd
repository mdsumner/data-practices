## Data practices

- how are we doing?
- frustrations, gaps in capability
- shared understanding of best work practices?
- shared tools and data
- contributing to better workflows, better tools

## Outline

- general approach
- key resources
- importance of projects and Github for collaboration
- raadtools, a key shared tool for data access

General theme: getting help, and being helpful, are acquired skills!

## General approach

We promote a shared toolkit approach: 

- data repositories - sources and file collections of remote sensing, environmental data, model output
- a software toolkit - common tools built around a data repository
- project-based workflow 

Getting started: 

- what computer/s, and where is the data?
- tools (data read, processing, version control, commmunications)
- how to get help?

## Key resources

All involve collaborative community contributions

- **soki.aq** The Southern Ocean Knowledge and Information wiki
- **FREE books**: R for Data Science, R Packages, Advanced R
- **SoftwareCarpentry.org** lessons on automation, programming, version control, and SQL for databases
- ***Happy Git and GitHub for the useR***
- **DATATAS.com** and other local user groups, online forums (twitter, stackoverflow)
- **rOpenSci.org** community building software for transparent research practices

## Projects and Github

Examples of version control and content publishing using R projects:

## Shared tols

The *raadtools* toolkit example. 


## Importance of community contributions!
 
Archiving software tools in the public domain is very important!

- we are required to do this for data 
- our tools and workflows are of direct interest
- best way to archive, share and collaborate is with version-controlled projects
- learning to organize a project to carefully separate internal / external is not obvious!

When you find out stuff, consider where the knowledge lives:  can it be written into SOKI, can you share it with others at local meetings, is it good material in a Github hosted project?

## Summary

- useful discussion?
- what else? Quaterly meetings?
- see you on SOKI and Github :)
